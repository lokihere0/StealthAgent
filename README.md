## **Overview**

**StealthAgent** is a comprehensive toolkit designed to secure, encrypt, and stealthily deploy executable files (EXEs) by embedding them inside self-extracting EXEs or DLLs. It is intended for developers, penetration testers. 

<b>StealthAgent employs techniques such as:</b>

- **XOR Encryption** for lightweight, fast obfuscation.
- **Run-Length Encoding (RLE)** for compression of payloads without sacrificing stealth.
- **Random Padding** to generate unique file hashes, thwarting signature-based detection.

### **Key Features:**

- **Self-Extracting EXE** creation that unpacks and runs the embedded payload without leaving traces on disk.
- **Encrypted EXE embedding** into stealthy DLLs, ideal for integration with legitimate software.
- **Advanced obfuscation & encryption** techniques, including XOR encryption and custom padding.
- **High versatility**, supporting both EXE and DLL formats for different deployment strategies.

|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Encryption**          | XOR-based encryption with a unique key for every file.                                |
| **Compression**         | Proprietary compression reduces size without compromising data integrity.             |
| **Execution**           | Seamless in-memory execution via dynamically created DLLs.                            |
| **Compatibility**       | Works flawlessly with Windows systems and GCC.                                        |
| **Stealth**             | Randomized data injection ensures detection evasion.                                  |

## **Attributes**

### 1. **XOR Encryption**
   - **What is it?** A symmetric encryption technique that obfuscates your EXE files.
   - **Why it matters:** Ensures that even if your EXE is intercepted, its contents remain unreadable unless the key is known.

### 2. **Run-Length Encoding (RLE) Compression**
   - **What is it?** A data compression method that reduces file size by encoding repeating byte sequences.
   - **Why it matters:** Minimizes the payload size, improving efficiency while maintaining stealth.

### 3. **Random Padding for Unique Hashes**
   - **What is it?** Padding added to your encrypted payload to generate a unique file hash every time.
   - **Why it matters:** Prevents signature-based detection and makes reverse engineering more difficult.

### 4. **Self-Extracting EXE Creation**
   - **What is it?** A generated EXE that unpacks and runs the embedded payload in a streamlined process.
   - **Why it matters:** Ensures no remnants are left on disk, reducing detection by antivirus tools.

### 5. **DLL with Embedded EXE**
   - **What is it?** A DLL that holds and executes your EXE as part of the DLL's operations. Useful for embedding payloads into legitimate software or during post-compilation processes.
   - **Why it matters:** Enables stealthy execution within another application or system process.

## Ô∏è Usage Instructions

### 1. **Prepare the Environment**
Ensure the following tools are installed on your system:
- GCC (MinGW recommended for Windows systems)
- A compatible EXE file for encryption

### 2. **Encrypt Your EXE File into a SFX File**
```bash
exeagent.exe --exe-path <path_to_your_exe> --output <path_to_output.exe> --gcc-path <path_to_gcc>
```
### 2. **Encrypt Your EXE File into a DLL**
```bash
dllagent.exe --exe-path <path_to_your_exe_or_sfx_file> --output <path_to_output.dll> --gcc-path <path_to_gcc>
```

### 3. **Execute the DLL**
- Place the DLL in a secure directory.
- Use a loader to run the DLL or integrate it into your application.
```bash
regsvr32 output.dll
```

## **In-Depth Technical Walkthrough**

### **XOR Encryption and Decryption**  
XOR encryption applies a key to each byte of the EXE file. The same key is used for both encryption and decryption. Though simple, it offers effective obfuscation.

### **Run-Length Encoding (RLE) Compression**  
RLE reduces payload size by converting repeating byte sequences into a more compact format. This helps reduce the EXE size and adds another layer of obfuscation.

### **Random Padding for Unique Hashes**  
Padding ensures that every generated file has a unique fingerprint, preventing detection through static file signature-based methods.

### **C Code Integration & Compilation**  
The encrypted and compressed EXE is embedded into C code. The code is then compiled using GCC to produce either a self-extracting EXE or DLL. This ensures that no remnants of the original EXE remain on disk.

---

## **Features**

### **Custom Compilation Framework**  
The generated DLLs and executables are structured with efficient code and optimized for various architectures. Each build undergoes rigorous testing to ensure compatibility and functionality across diverse runtime environments.

### **High-Performance Compression & Encryption**  
An innovative compression algorithm paired with dynamic encryption mechanisms ensures data integrity and confidentiality. These features work in tandem to reduce payload size while maintaining unparalleled security.

### **Sophisticated Code Obfuscation**  
The core compilation techniques ensure the generated binaries are resistant to reverse engineering and static analysis. This guarantees operational secrecy and secures the integrity of the execution flow.


---

## **Security Considerations**

### **Counteracting Reverse Engineering**  
XOR encryption is basic and not fully secure. The following measures are implemented to improve security:

- **Dynamic Key Generation:** Keys are managed in a way that prevents static analysis.
- **Multi-layer Encryption:** Multiple encryption methods are used to add layers of obfuscation, enhancing security.
- **Code Obfuscation:** Techniques are applied to obscure the code, making reverse engineering more difficult.

### **Advanced Encryption Techniques**  
AES-256 or RSA encryption is used for robust security, providing significantly stronger protection than XOR encryption.

---

## **Troubleshooting & FAQs**

### **Common Errors and Solutions**

- **Error: "GCC not found"**  
  Solution: Ensure that MinGW is installed and that the `bin` folder is included in your system‚Äôs PATH.

- **Error: "File not found"**  
  Solution: Double-check the paths to your EXE and output files to ensure they are correct.

- **Error: "Invalid EXE format"**  
  Solution: Verify that the EXE is properly compiled and compatible with the toolset.
